# office_week_2

If you just want to run the game, click the file Officeweek2.swf in the bin directory.


If you want to compile, it is assumed you know what you're doing, or are willing to experiment. Hopefully though, it should just be to open the project file (this project file is generated by Flashpunk, but possibly it can be opened by other IDEs it as well) and press the compile/run button. Hopefully that's it, if not, look around a bit and see if you can solve the issue, maybe updating something, setting some path variable or installing some library.
