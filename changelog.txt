<ul> 
<li>Massively improved performance. Now doing things only when it's needed instead of all the time. This will probably solve some weird problems that was occurring.</li>
<li>Added option to study. This will increase your IQ, but will cost more money the smarter you already are. Beware, bimbos do not study very well.</li>
<li>Heavily increased salary from work. You will however now get less money the more horny you are.</li>
<li>The longer you are an employee at Bimnocorp, the higher will now your sex drive be, making you horny faster over time.</li>
<li>Can now buy stockings. Having stockings will increase the amount of money you get from having sex. (Wearing them is optional.)</li>
<li>Upgraded backgrounds a bit.</li>
<li>Slightly changed UI.</li>
<li>Added a short background story to opening screen.</li>
</ul>
